## 🔬 About Me

I'm currently pursuing a B.S. in Data Science at the University of the Incarnate Word, with a previous degree in Biology. My interdisciplinary background allows me to merge statistical rigor with scientific thinking. I enjoy working on projects where I can turn raw data into actionable solutions—whether in healthcare, retail, or finance.
